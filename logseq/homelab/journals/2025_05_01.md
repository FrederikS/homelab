- How to keep [[k3s]]-[[ansible]] fork in sync?
	- The idea is to keep all homelab related stuff in a common repository
	- To still be able to get updates from upstream repository for the k3s ansible bootstrap, but still be able to re-structure the repository, the strategy is to have a separate branch for managing upstream changes
	- There is a `upstream-sync` branch which is in sync with upstream repository
		- Fetch updates:
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- ```shell
			  git checkout upstream-sync
			  git fetch upstream
			  git merge upstream/master
			  git push origin upstream-sync
			  ```
		- Merge updates into your custom branch:
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- ```shell
			  git checkout master
			  git merge upstream-sync
			  ```
		- Resolve conflicts, if any, then commit and push:
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- ```shell
			  git add .
			  git commit -m "Merge upstream updates into master"
			  git push origin master
			  ```
